	This code, somewhat-inaccurately entitled "dropfix", fixes some infamous
	instances of tainting in the World of Warcraft Lua API. It is embeddable
	and should be included as a standalone file if you wish to use it.

	First, it fixes the tainting issues with the UIDropDownMenu subsystem
	(often inaccurately identified as UIDROPDOWNMENU_MENU_LEVEL taint,
	including initially by myself), one to do with the
	UIDropDownMenu_GetSelectedX() functions, and the other to do with
	UIDropDownMenu_Initialize() and the last opened menu (via
	ToggleDropDownMenu()) having an insecure displayMode key.

	Second, it fixes the issue of tainting the Interface Options panel when an
	addon makes use of InterfaceOptions_AddCategory() (which was designed for
	addons to use). The issue is that InterfaceOptionsFrameCategories.selection
	sometimes becomes tainted and proceeds to taint the full panel refresh.

	The two of these are both most famous for tainting the built-in raid
	frames, and for having that taint easily spread to other secure UI
	elements.

	The fixes for these take advantage of a quirk, likely intentional, of the
	secure variable system in the Lua API. Any variable in a table other than
	_G will become secure if it is set to nil, regardless of if it is set to
	nil from insecure code. This means that problematic insecure keys, which
	are the source of every taint issue this code addresses, can be "secured"
	by simply wiping them out.
