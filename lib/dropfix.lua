	This code, somewhat-inaccurately entitled "dropfix", fixes some infamous
	instances of tainting in the World of Warcraft Lua API. It is embeddable
	and should be included as a standalone file if you wish to use it.

	First, it fixes the tainting issues with the UIDropDownMenu subsystem
	(often inaccurately identified as UIDROPDOWNMENU_MENU_LEVEL taint),
	primarily to do with the UIDropDownMenu_Refresh() function.

	Second, it fixes the issue of tainting the Interface Options panel when an
	addon uses InterfaceOptions_AddCategory(). The issue is that
	InterfaceOptionsFrameCategories.selection sometimes becomes tainted and
	proceeds to taint the next full panel refresh.

	The fixes for these take advantage of a quirk of the secure variable system
	in the Lua API. Any variable in a table other than _G will become secure if
	it is set to nil, regardless of if it is set to nil from insecure code.
	This means that problematic insecure keys, which are the source of every
	taint issue this code addresses, can be "secured" by simply wiping them
	out.
