6.0.3.0_beta5 (2014-12-10):

	- beta5: beta4 and earlier users should restart WoW when installing, some
	  files have been added/moved/removed relative to older versions.

	- beta5: Multiple bugs from beta4 have been fixed.

		- Crossrealm group profiles should now work.

		- LFR and Battleground groups should now be handled correctly.

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed prior to upgrading. This version
	  of XRP has been reorganized into a single addon folder, rather than
	  multiple smaller addons.

	- Support for RP profiles over Battle.net and party/raid has been added.
	  This is supported in XRP 6.0.3.0+, with a library allowing other RP
	  addons to support these coming soon.

	- ChatThrottleLib has been replaced by a new bandwidth library. If you
	  encounter any errors related to ChatThrottleLib after upgrading, please
	  report them immediately.

	- The minimap tooltip has drastically changed, and now has generally
	  useful information.

	- The detached minimap button is now moved by shift+right click and drag,
	  rather than unlocking it.

	- The interface options panels have been redone completely. Settings now
	  update dynamically (rather than needing to press "Okay" to see changes),
	  and the layout of the options has changed.

	- The internal naming of the editor, automation config, and viewer frames
	  has changed. If you were making use of these (such as with an addon that
	  allows movement of UI panels), you may need to reconfigure it. If you
	  don't know what this means, you probably don't need to worry.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The minimap button positioning has been reset and the default
		  changed to hopefully avoid being obstructed by the Garrison button.

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.

		- The editor will now properly display the fallback values for name,
		  race, and class (in grey) when they are not set for a profile or its
		  parents.

		- The viewer currently/description/motto/history fields will now
		  correctly hide their scrollbars when appropriate.

		- The viewer should no longer scroll a single pixel for descriptions
		  or histories of a particular length.

		- Roleplay names will now be used in channel leave/join messages, if
		  they are enabled for that channel.

		- Some mage water elementals should no longer be referred to as "MT -
		  Water Elemental", instead of the proper "Elemental" in the tooltip.

		- Instances of "Character is not found." errors should be reduced or
		  eliminated.

		- Added a warning if the raid profiles dialog is opened when the
		  interface options is closed about possible tainting caused by
		  Blizzard bugs.
