6.1.2.0_rc1 (2015-05-25):

	- If you are upgrading from 6.1.0.0 or earlier, please fully-restart the
	  game client when upgrading. Some new files have been added, and a
	  restart is necessary for the game client to see these.

	- Private notes may now be added to information about characters. Adding
	  or viewing notes may be done from the viewer, the bookmarks, or, for
	  your current character, from the editor.

	- Options have been added (under the new XRP -> Display category in the
	  interface options) to replace certain race names with alternate or
	  translated values (such as replacing "Undead" with "Forsaken" or "Blood
	  Elf" with "Sin'dorei", among others).

	- XRP's profile viewer is now resizable. Use the handle at the
	  bottom-right of the frame to resize. Right-clicking the handle will
	  reset the size to default.

	- Some menu items have been moved in the profile viewer and editor. Please
	  check the menus in the upper-right corner of each of these frames if you
	  believe something to be missing. Additionally, the "Export" menu entry
	  has been moved to the "Advanced" submenu in the viewer and bookmarks.

	- Indentations are now properly handled in the profile viewer.
	  Additionally, pressing "Shift+Tab" while editing a multi-line field in
	  the editor will now input eight spaces (a tab width).

	- Clickable URLs in profiles have been changed somewhat, now bracketed by
	  angle brackets instead of square brackets. In addition, the URL-matching
	  has been adjusted to (hopefully) match more URLs properly.

	- Profiles may now be force-refreshed (if you suspect something hasn't
	  loaded correctly) and profiles may also now be individually dropped from
	  your stored cache. These are not normally necessary, and improvements
	  have been made elsewhere to make them even less normally necessary.

	- Colorblind mode should now be properly supported in XRP's tooltip.

	- Support for translating XRP into languages other than English has been
	  added. If you're interested in providing a translation, please get in
	  contact with XRP's author.

		- Support for multibyte characters (accented Latin, foreign scripts,
		  etc.) has been significantly improved in the tooltip and export.

	- Display of weights in kilograms is now slightly more precise.

	- (Bugfix) The "Roleplay Profile" entry will no longer show for Battle.net
	  chat when the person isn't on your friends list (such as in a
	  conversation).

	- Quite a few aspects of the UI implementation have been overhauled. If
	  you're modifying the UI (such as for skin authors), you may need to
	  recheck some values. Most should be the same, but that's not guaranteed.
