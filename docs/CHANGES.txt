6.0.3.1 (2015-01-02):

	- !! IMPORTANT !!
	  ===============
	  Please read the below three points prior to upgrading. There are a large
	  number of changes in this version of XRP, and the change to the folder
	  setup may require a bit more attention when upgrading than usual.

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

	- New stuff:

		- Support for RP profiles over Battle.net and crossrealm party/raid
		  has been added. This is supported in XRP 6.0.3.0+ currently, with an
		  implementation usable by authors of other addons currently being
		  tested.

		- ChatThrottleLib has been replaced by a new bandwidth library. If you
		  encounter any errors related to ChatThrottleLib (or libbw) after
		  upgrading, please report them immediately.

		- Profile automation config is now accessed through the editor.

		- The minimap tooltip has drastically changed, and now has generally
		  useful information, rather than simply a help tooltip.

		- The interface options have been redone completely. Settings now
		  update dynamically (rather than needing to press "Okay" to see
		  changes), and the layout of the options has changed.

		- The option to use (hard-to-read) faction colors instead of
		  green/yellow/red reaction colors on tooltips has been removed.

		- The internal naming of the editor and viewer frames has changed. If
		  you were making use of these (such as with an addon that allows
		  movement of UI panels), you may need to reconfigure it. If you don't
		  know what this means, you probably don't need to worry.

			- To enable moving via external addons, you may also need to
			  enable the viewer/editor frame preloading in the advanced
			  section of the XRP options. Usually these are only loaded when
			  needed, but frame moving addons may require them to be present
			  at start.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Attached minimap button positioning has been reset and the default
		  changed to hopefully avoid being obstructed by the Garrison button.

		- Roleplay names will now be used in channel leave/join messages, if
		  they are enabled for that channel.

		- Some mage water elementals should no longer be referred to as "MT -
		  Water Elemental", instead of the proper "Elemental" in the tooltip.

		- Instances of "Character is not found." errors should be reduced or
		  eliminated.

		- Issues with profile swapping for non-Worgen druids have been fixed.

		- Numerous other minor bugs have been fixed.

		- From 6.0.3.0: Disconnects should stop now again. I'm an idiot.
