6.1.0.0_rc1 (2015-02-14):

	- This version has been tested with both 6.0.3 (live) and 6.1.0 (PTR), and
	  works correctly with both versions.

	- (rc1) A new tooltip mode, separating the roleplay information from the
	  main tooltip has been added. Disable "replace tooltip for players and
	  pets" in the interface options to enable this mode.

	- (rc1) Length warnings have been added to fields in the editor. These are
	  just recommendations, not hard limits.

	- (rc1) Height/weight conversion has been made a bit less overzealous.

	- (rc1) Help system has been added to the viewer. Other frames have had
	  some texts changed and overlay positions fixed.

	- (rc1) Frame preloading has been removed. All major frames are now
	  created at UI load time.

	- A major new UI component has been added, the long-promised bookmarks
	  panel. This panel is accessible from the minimap button, from the
	  '/xrp bookmarks' chat command, and from a newly-added keybinding.

		- The bookmarks panel provides some limited mechanisms to filter and
		  search through all profiles XRP has cached, including a few
		  predefined views (your bookmarks, your own characters, recently seen
		  profiles, and all profiles).

	- A profile exporter, which allows you to copy a plain-text version of a
	  profile, has been added. This exporter is accessed through the editor,
	  the viewer, and the bookmarks panel.

	- A simple in-game help system has been added to the bookmarks, editor,
	  and viewer frames. It is accessed by clicking the large yellow button
	  marked "i".

	- The viewer and bookmarks panel now have an option to add a character to
	  one's in-game friends list directly from either of those panels. The
	  friends are added with a note indicating their roleplay name, and may be
	  removed through the standard social panel.

	- Bugfix: Hidden profiles will no longer trigger the cursor book icon or
	  profile view-on-right-click. They may still be accessed through other
	  methods.

	- Bugfix: An issue in the bandwidth library which could, in circumstances
	  XRP alone would never trigger, cause disconnects. This has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: An issue where the character's GUID field (GU) would not always
	  be properly set has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: The importer (from other addons) will now properly only disable
	  those addons for the current character, rather than all characters.

	- Bugfix: Crossrealm profiles over Battle.net will now work correctly on
	  the first login after client launch.

	- Bugfix: Fixed a rare Lua error from the viewer menu interacting with
	  Blizzard code elsewhere. Enabling/disabling of these menu items, where
	  appropriate, has also been improved.

	- Bugfix: Fixed an extremely rare situation which could lead to fields not
	  properly being sent over group channels.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

		- Your profiles and settings are unaffected by these changes -- they
		  will still all be there after upgrading.

	- The full list of changes for 6.0.3.0 can be found in the notes for that
	  release or 6.0.3.1.
