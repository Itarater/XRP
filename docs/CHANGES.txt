6.2.2.2 (2015-09-23):

	- (Bugfix) Fixed a rare issue that could create unclickable links in the
	  profile viewer.

	- (Bugfix) Fixed an issue that could prevent the bookmarks full-text
	  search from working.

	- (Bugfix) Completely (hopefully) fixed the tainting issues with dropdown
	  menus and, especially, the built-in raid frames. In theory, WoW should
	  never blame XRP for taint now.

	- (Bugfix) Prevent "Report player Away" menu entries in Battlegrounds from
	  failing, by removing those buttons where appropriate.

		- Note: Players may still be reported AFK from the scoreboard or from
		  the battleground map. The only menus affected are the chat menus and
		  unit frame menus -- and only if XRP's integration with those is
		  enabled.

	- (Bugfix) Fixed an issue with non-string values in the bandwidth library.

	- (Compatibility) The help overlay system will now properly work in ElvUI
	  and derivatives. You may note similar help systems appearing in other
	  addons where they formerly did not.
