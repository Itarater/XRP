6.1.2.0_beta3 (2015-05-14):

	- If you are upgrading from 6.1.0.0 or earlier, please fully-restart the
	  game client when upgrading. Some new files have been added, and a
	  restart is necessary for the game client to see these.

	- Private notes may now be added to information about characters. Adding
	  or viewing notes may be done from the viewer, the bookmarks, or, for
	  your current character, from the editor.

		- Characters (excluding your own) with notes are automatically
		  bookmarked and may not be unbookmarked until the notes are removed.

	- Options have been added (under the new XRP -> Display category in the
	  interface options) to replace certain race names with alternate or
	  translated values (such as replacing "Undead" with "Forsaken" or "Blood
	  Elf" with "Sin'dorei", among others).

	- XRP's profile viewer is now resizable. Use the handle at the
	  bottom-right of the frame to resize. Right-clicking the handle will
	  reset the size to default.

	- The addon version information displayed in the profile viewer may now be
	  moused over in order to see any further addons or version numbers which
	  do not fit in the available space.

	- Clickable URLs in profiles have been changed somewhat, now bracketed by
	  angle brackets instead of square brackets. In addition, the URL-matching
	  has been adjusted to (hopefully) match more URLs properly.

		- Furthermore, additional changes have been made that make encasing
		  URLs in your own profile in angle brackets (such as
		  <http://example.com/something.html>) a good idea, as XRP will be
		  certain to not include extra letters at the end when doing so. It is
		  not required, but it is recommended.

	- Some improvements have been made to field version handling, likely
	  avoiding rare issues with profiles failing to update after the subject
	  has recently reinstalled or wiped their addon data.

		- More changes will be coming in the future, including the ability to
		  force-reload profiles, without wiping the full cache, if absolutely
		  necessary.

	- Colorblind mode should now be properly supported in XRP's tooltip.

	- Support for translating XRP into languages other than English has been
	  added. If you're interested in providing a translation, please get in
	  contact with XRP's author.

	- Display of weights in kilograms is now slightly more precise.

	- (Bugfix) The "Roleplay Profile" entry will no longer show for Battle.net
	  chat when the person isn't on your friends list (such as in a
	  conversation).

	- Quite a few aspects of the UI implementation have been overhauled. If
	  you're modifying the UI (such as for skin authors), you may need to
	  recheck some values. Most should be the same, but that's not guaranteed.
