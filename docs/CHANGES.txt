6.0.3.2 (2015-01-05):

	- This release only includes minor changes and bugfixes. Please see the
	  section below these notes if you are upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or earlier.

	- New: There is now a setting in the Advanced section of XRP's options to
	  make the Viewer movable by clicking/dragging its title bar. This option
	  requires the frame be preloaded, also set in the Advanced section.

	- Bug fix: Profiles with no default character status set (set to "(None)")
	  will no longer trigger an error when clicking the minimap button.

	- Bug fix: Certain settings will no longer revert to default when
	  upgrading from 6.0.2.1, and will be set to your pre-6.0.3.0 selection.
	  If you had intentionally changed those settings since upgrading, you may
	  need to toggle them again.

	- Fix: An interaction with Scrap (and potentially with other addons)
	  producing an error in some circumstances has been fixed.

	- Bandwidth usage in crossrealm party/raid situations with multiple XRP
	  users from multiple different realms should be slightly reduced.

	- Profile data requests may occur more quickly in high-bandwidth
	  situations.

	- Raid warnings will now show roleplay names, if roleplay names are
	  enabled for raid.

	- LibMSP compatibility layer has been updated to work better.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- !! IMPORTANT !!
	  ===============
	  Please read the below three points prior to upgrading from XRP 6.0.2.1
	  or earlier. There are a large number of changes since that version of
	  XRP, and the change to the folder setup may require a bit more attention
	  when upgrading than usual.

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

	- New stuff:

		- Support for RP profiles over Battle.net and crossrealm party/raid
		  has been added. This is supported in XRP 6.0.3.0+ currently, with an
		  implementation usable by authors of other addons currently being
		  tested.

		- ChatThrottleLib has been replaced by a new bandwidth library. If you
		  encounter any errors related to ChatThrottleLib (or libbw) after
		  upgrading, please report them immediately.

	- The full list of changes for 6.0.3.0 can be found in the notes for that
	  release or 6.0.3.1.
