6.2.0.0_rc2 (2015-06-11):

	- If you are upgrading from XRP 6.1.0.0 or earlier, please fully-restart
	  the game client when upgrading. Some new files have been added, and a
	  restart is necessary for the game client to see these.

	- This version supports 6.1.2 (live) and 6.2.0 (PTR).

	- Private notes may now be added to information about characters. Adding
	  or viewing notes may be done from the viewer, the bookmarks, or, for
	  your current character, from the editor. These are accessible from the
	  menus in the upper-right of the editor/viewer, or from the right-click
	  menu in the bookmarks.

	- Options have been added (under the new XRP -> Display category in the
	  interface options) to replace certain race names with alternate or
	  translated values (such as replacing "Undead" with "Forsaken" or "Blood
	  Elf" with "Sin'dorei", among others).

	- XRP's profile viewer is now resizable. Use the handle at the
	  bottom-right of the frame to resize. Right-clicking the handle will
	  reset the size to default.

	- Some menu items have been moved in the profile viewer and editor. Please
	  check the menus in the upper-right corner of each of these frames if you
	  believe something to be missing. Additionally, the "Export" menu entry
	  has been moved to the "Advanced" submenu in the viewer and bookmarks.

	- Indentations are now properly handled in the profile viewer.
	  Additionally, pressing "Shift+Tab" while editing a multi-line field in
	  the editor will now input eight spaces (equivalent of a tab character).

	- Clickable URLs in profiles have been changed somewhat, now bracketed by
	  angle brackets instead of square brackets. In addition, the URL-matching
	  has been adjusted to (hopefully) match more URLs properly.

		- Direct links to Twitter accounts (@UserName or
		  http://twitter.com/UserName) are now specially linked, and can be
		  used to access the in-game Twitter functionality, if enabled.

	- Profiles may now be force-refreshed (if you suspect something hasn't
	  loaded correctly) and profiles may also now be individually dropped from
	  your stored cache. These options are not normally needed, but have been
	  added to help in abnormal circumstances.

	- Colorblind mode should now be properly supported in XRP's tooltip.

	- Support for translating XRP into languages other than English has been
	  added. Support for multibyte characters has also been improved.

		- If you're interested in providing a translation, please get in
		  contact with XRP's author.

	- Quite a few aspects of the UI implementation have been overhauled. If
	  you're modifying the UI (such as for skin authors), you may need to
	  recheck some values. Most should be the same, but that's not guaranteed.
