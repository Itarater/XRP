6.1.0.0_beta2 (2015-02-03):

	- This version has been tested with both 6.0.3 (live) and 6.1.0 (PTR), and
	  works correctly with both versions.

	- A major new UI component has been added, the long-promised bookmarks
	  panel. This panel is accessible from the minimap button, from the
	  '/xrp bookmarks' chat command, and from a newly-added keybinding.

		- The bookmarks panel provides some limited mechanisms to filter and
		  search through all profiles XRP has cached, including a few
		  predefined views (your bookmarks, your own characters, recently seen
		  profiles, and all profiles).

	- (beta2) A profile exporter, which allows you to copy a plain-text
	  version of a profile, has been added. This exporter is accessed through
	  the editor, the viewer, and the bookmarks panel.

	- (beta2) The viewer and bookmarks panel now have an option to add a
	  character to one's in-game friends list directly from either of those
	  panels. The friends are added with a note indicating their roleplay
	  name, and may be removed through the standard social panel.

	- (beta2) Bugfix: Hidden profiles will no longer trigger the cursor book
	  icon or profile view-on-right-click. They may still be accessed through
	  other methods.

	- Bugfix: An issue in the bandwidth library which could, in circumstances
	  XRP alone would never trigger, cause disconnects. This has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: An issue where the character's GUID field (GU) would not always
	  be properly set has been fixed.

	- (beta2) Bugfix: The importer (from other addons) will now properly only
	  disable those addons for the current character, rather than all
	  characters.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

	- The full list of changes for 6.0.3.0 can be found in the notes for that
	  release or 6.0.3.1.
