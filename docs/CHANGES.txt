6.2.2.1 (2015-09-11):

	- Several changes have been made for Mercenary Mode to account for API
	  improvements made late in the PTR cycle.

		- Improved faction detection when looking at other players as
		  Mercenaries.

		- Improved detection of being a Mercenary (rated battlegrounds will no
		  longer sometimes be mistaken for Mercenary Mode).

		- Improved profile request attempts while a Mercenary or while
		  examining Mercenaries.

	- The Mercenary autoswap profile has explicitly been renamed to "Mercenary
	  Mode" to avoid potential confusion with any equipment sets named
	  "Mercenary" (if you name a set "Mercenary Mode", you're on your own).
