6.2.0.1 (2015-06-22):

	- This version supports World of Warcraft 6.1.2 and 6.2.0.

	- If you are upgrading from XRP 6.1.0.0 or earlier, please fully-restart
	  the game client when upgrading. Some new files have been added, and a
	  restart is necessary for the game client to see these.

	- A Lua error for new installs has been fixed.

	- Fields which contain only whitespace are now treated as though they were
	  completely empty (avoiding issues with lost information in tooltips,
	  especially).

	- Many other changes were made in 6.2.0.0. Please see the changelog for
	  that version for more information.
