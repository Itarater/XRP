6.1.0.0_beta1 (2015-01-31):

	- A major new UI component has been added, the long-promised bookmarks
	  panel. This panel is accessible from the minimap button, from the
	  '/xrp bookmarks' chat command, and from a newly-added keybinding.

		- The bookmarks panel provides some limited mechanisms to filter and
		  search through all profiles XRP has cached, including a few
		  predefined views (your bookmarks, your own characters, recently seen
		  profiles, and all profiles).

	- Bookmarks and hidden profiles are now marked and stored outside of the
	  cache. Hard-resetting the cache (not something possible in XRP's UI)
	  will no longer remove the bookmark or hidden profile markings.

	- Bugfix: An issue in the bandwidth library which could, in circumstances
	  XRP alone would never trigger, cause disconnects. This has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: An issue where the character's GUID field (GU) would not always
	  be properly set has been fixed.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

	- The full list of changes for 6.0.3.0 can be found in the notes for that
	  release or 6.0.3.1.
