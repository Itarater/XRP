6.0.3.3 (2015-01-19):

	- This release only includes minor changes and bugfixes. Please see the
	  section below these notes if you are upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or earlier.

	- The option for a movable profile viewer has been moved to a more
	  prominent location.

	  by pressing Escape.

	- Bug fix: A rare circumstance that could cause a Lua error at start has
	  been fixed.

	  Fields will no longer re-send until they've finished being sent in the
	  first place, in addition to the other precautions.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- !! IMPORTANT !!
	  ===============
	  Please read the below points prior to upgrading from XRP 6.0.2.1 or
	  earlier. There are a large number of changes since that version of XRP,
	  and the change to the folder setup may require a bit more attention when
	  upgrading than usual.

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

		- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically,
		  consolidated into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that
		  you have a single "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after
		  upgrading.

		- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements
		  by disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from
		  the XRP interface options panel instead.

	- The full list of changes for 6.0.3.0 can be found in the notes for that
	  release or 6.0.3.1.
