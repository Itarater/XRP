6.1.0.0 (2015-02-24):

	- A major new UI component has been added, the long-promised bookmarks
	  panel. This panel is accessible from the minimap button, from the
	  '/xrp bookmarks' chat command, and from a newly-added keybinding.

		- The bookmarks panel provides some limited mechanisms to filter and
		  search through all profiles XRP has cached, including a few
		  predefined views.

	- A simple in-game help system has been added to the bookmarks, editor,
	  and viewer frames. It is accessed by clicking the large yellow button
	  marked "i".

	- A profile exporter, which allows you to copy a plain-text version of a
	  profile, has been added. This exporter is accessed through the editor,
	  the viewer, and the bookmarks frames.

	- A new tooltip mode, separating the roleplay information from the main
	  tooltip has been added. Disable "replace tooltip for players and pets"
	  in the interface options to enable this mode.

	- A "Roleplay Profile" menu entry has been added to Battle.net friends
	  list entries, like for in-game friends. This views the profile of their
	  active character and is only available when they're in WoW.

	- In the viewer, the nickname, title, and house/clan/tribe lines may now
	  be moused over to see their full content if they're truncated.

	- Recommended length warnings have been added to fields in the editor.

	- A basic profile importer for TotalRP3 is available now. It only imports
	  the currently-active profile due to limitations in TRP3's profiles
	  (profiles are not associated with a character unless they are active).

	- Bugfix: Hidden profiles will no longer trigger the cursor book icon or
	  profile view-on-right-click. They may still be accessed through other
	  methods.

	- Bugfix: An issue in the bandwidth library which could, in circumstances
	  XRP alone would never trigger, cause disconnects has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: An issue where the character's GUID field (GU) would not always
	  be properly set has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: The importer (from other addons) will now properly only disable
	  those addons for the current character, rather than all characters.

	- Bugfix: Detection of other addons being enabled (for adding to your
	  tooltip) has been fixed.

	- Bugfix: Crossrealm profiles over Battle.net will now work correctly on
	  the first login after client launch.

	- Bugfix: Fixed an extremely rare situation which could lead to fields not
	  properly being sent over group channels.

For 6.0.2.1 or earlier users:

	- Old versions of XRP should be removed from the Interface/AddOns folder
	  prior to upgrading from 6.0.2.1 or lower (automated installers should
	  handle this on their own), and the game client should be fully restarted
	  (rather than logout or UI reload) after upgrading.

	- The internal file layout of XRP has changed drastically, consolidated
	  into a single folder. If in doubt, please check that you have a single
	  "xrp" folder in your Interface/AddOns folder after upgrading.

	- If you were previously disabling chat names or tooltip replacements by
	  disabling those modules as addons, you can now disable them from the XRP
	  interface options panel instead.

	- Your profiles are unaffected by any of these changes -- they will still
	  all be there after upgrading.
