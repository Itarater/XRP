6.2.2.0 (2015-09-01):

	- Support added for Mercenary mode. This support includes:

		- Display fixes and adjustments to compensate for the issues
		  introduced into the API by Mercenary mode.

		- Automated profile swapping when entering Mercenary mode. This swap,
		  if enabled, takes precedence over all other forms and equipment sets
		  when in Mercenary mode.

	- The default position of the minimap button has been adjusted slightly,
	  as to not overlap with the group finder button in the default UI.

	- (Bugfix/Partial) Some reduction in the potential for triggering Blizzard
	  bugs that can taint the standard raid frames. Most situations which can
	  still taint the raid frames should warn and recommend reloading the UI.
