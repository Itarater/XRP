6.2.4.0 (2016-03-19):

	- This version supports both World of Warcraft 6.2.3 and 6.2.4.

	- Support for names in chat in Prat-3.0 has been added.

	- Support for an optional LibDataBroker object (for Titan Panel, Chocolate
	  Bar, etc.) has been added. This may be enabled in the general XRP
	  options.

	- An optional (enabled by default) flag icon has been added to the
	  tooltip, indicating a bookmarked profile.

	- Support for reading the OOC currently field from TRP users has been
	  added. For maximum compatibility, XRP will *not* send this field to
	  other addons, but *will* see it when other addons send it.

	- The tooltip eye icon, indicating a player is targeting you, is enabled
	  by default now. The setting for existing installs will not be changed.

	- An option has been added to only show profiles from characters on your
	  friends list (in-game and Battle.net) and, optionally, in your current
	  character's guild. This is NOT RECOMMENDED for use unless you know why
	  you want to use it and exactly what it does; it may be found in the
	  advanced options.

	- Support for upgrading from VERY old versions of XRP (pre-6.0) has been
	  dropped.

	- (BUGFIX) The export button in the profile editor should now always work.

	- (BUGFIX) Fixed an issue where player not found errors could sometimes
	  spam the chatbox following a loading screen.

	- The addon folder name has been changed from "xrp" to "XRP". As this only
	  changes the case of the name, no issues should occur on
	  Blizzard-supported installs.

		- For Linux/WINE users, be sure to remove the old
		  Interface/AddOns/xrp/ folder prior to installing the new version,
		  and rename any WTF/Account/**/SavedVariables/xrp.lua files to
		  XRP.lua if you encounter any issues.
