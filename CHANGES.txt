7.0.3.2 (2016-08-06):

	- Support for displaying house/clan/tribe in tooltip has been added. This
	  is off by default, and may be toggled on in the tooltip options.

	- Broader support for pets, including temporary pets/guardians, has been
	  added to XRP's tooltip support. This does NOT include battle pets.

	- A number of minor errors with class colors on pet tooltips have been
	  fixed (only permanent pets/guardians should show a class color now).

	- Detection of switching into/out of Shadowform has been fixed.

	- Tooltips will now again display "Level ??" if the unit's level is truly
	  unknown.
