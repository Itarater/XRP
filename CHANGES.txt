7.2.0.0 (2017-03-28):

	- Default tooltip colors have been changed for names (matching outline
	  colors) and for factions (slightly more distinct color for Alliance,
	  especially).

		- The old colors are available in XRP's options. These may be removed
		  at some point in the future, depending on feedback.

	- OOC brackets are no longer sometimes duplicated in currently strings
	  from TRP users.

	- Pet faction detection should work more reliably.
