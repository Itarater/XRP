7.0.3.0 (2016-07-19):

	- This version supports World of Warcraft 7.0 (Legion pre-patch) only.

		- A number of minor fixes have been made. Using previous versions of
		  XRP in 7.0 will NOT work properly, updating is STRONGLY recommended.

	- Officer chat again supports RP names. This setting will default to that
	  of your guild chat, but may be changed independently.

	- Default settings changed (for new installs, existing installs unchanged):

		- Chat replacements (%xt/%xf) now default to off, as they're somewhat
		  CPU-intensive while typing in chat.

		- Replacement of "Undead" with "Forsaken" for Undead-race players in
		  XRP's tooltips and viewer now defaults to on, as Blizzard has
		  switched to using Forsaken in many of the in-game references to this
		  race (and it's less likely to be confused with the Undead creature
		  type or Undead battle pet type).

	- Nicknames that already include opening/closing quotation marks should
	  now display properly.

	- Unusual ways of listing height in ft/in should more commonly convert
	  properly (such as 9'9'', using double apostrophes).

	- Support for importing from TotalRP2 has been dropped.
