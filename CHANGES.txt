7.0.3.1 (2016-07-29):

	- Tooltip pet class detection has been fixed for Mechanicals (Hunter) and
	  Abominations (Death Knight).

	- Tooltip player level detection for hostile players ten levels or more
	  above you has been fixed (to show their real level).

	- Support for filtering demon hunters from the bookmarks browser has been
	  added.

	- Issues with tooltips sometimes not drawing (usually when mousing over
	  target-of-target frames from custom unit frame addons) have been fixed.

	- Issues with importing from other addons have hopefully been fixed (rare
	  issue).
