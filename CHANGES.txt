6.2.3.0 (2015-11-17):

	- This is a small update, primarily released to handle the issue with
	  absent Battle.net realms more gracefully, as the bug has been
	  reintroduced following this morning's maintenance.

		- Crossrealm/crossfaction profiles will *NOT* work so long as the
		  realm name is unavailable, but XRP will now give up after about 30
		  seconds of failed attempts to find realm names, saving some CPU
		  cycles.

	- Effective level display in the tooltip (i.e., timewalking, level-up
	  battlegrounds, etc.) has been changed to match how it is displayed in
	  default UI elements.
