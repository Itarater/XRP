7.2.0.3 (2017-04-14):

	- Added support for non-player emotes. Beginning an emote with | (a pipe
	  character) will reduce the name displayed to [X], where X is the first
	  character of the player's name.

		- This short name can be right-clicked for the standard chat menu to
		  find the player's full name and options to ignore or report.

	- Added an option to disable roleplay information on tooltips while in
	  instance combat (PvE/PvP instances and active world PvP zones).

	- Support displaying non-English realm names properly (with spaces,
	  hyphens, etc.) in tooltip.

	- Remove invalid byte sequences from displayed text. If special/accented
	  characters fail to display properly ever, please report this as a bug.

	- Fixed a Lua error on start related to LibDataBroker.
