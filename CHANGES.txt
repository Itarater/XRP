6.2.2.3 (2015-09-26):

	- Access to several UI elements in the viewer and editor have been moved
	  to be more easily accessible and intuitive.

		- Access to the notes panel (viewer/editor) is now provided by a small
		  button near the upper-right with a note icon and an arrow.

		- Access to the automation panel (editor) is now provided by a small
		  button near the upper-right with two small person outlines and an
		  arrow.

		- Access to the rename/copy/export functions (editor) have been moved
		  to buttons next to the add/remove controls.

		- Access to the profile export (viewer) has been moved to the main
		  dropdown menu rather than the Advanced submenu.

	- Using the %xt and %xf replacements should now save the originally
	  entered text (preserving the %xt/%xf) in the chat history, rather than
	  saving the replaced RP name.

	- The "Roleplay Profile" entry will no longer show on Battle.net friends
	  when the profile has no possibility of being viewed (i.e., when the
	  Battle.net system is not providing accurate realm information).

	- (Bugfix) Fixed an issue with the taint-fixing code that could produce
	  Lua errors in combination with certain questionable practices used by
	  other addons.
