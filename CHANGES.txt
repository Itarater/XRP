7.0.3.4 (2016-08-29):

	- (7.0.3.4) Fixed a Lua error changing settings for alternate race names.
	  Changes for 7.0.3.3 follow.

	- Options to only use alternate race names when on characters of that race
	  have been added. These default to on for all races other than Forsaken;
	  you may need to change these from the interface options if you want the
	  old behaviour.

	- Unsaved changes to profiles being edited are no longer discarded when a
	  new profile is switched to edit. Instead, confirming whether discarding
	  changes is intended is asked.

	- Multiple profile automation mappings can now be saved at once instead of
	  one at a time.

	- Detection of Moonkin Affinity form and Astral Moonkin Affinity form has
	  been fixed.

	- Additional warnings and attempts to fix the problem has been added for
	  potential cases of data corruption.

	- Some garbage collection for unused saved data has been added for profile
	  swap automation and roleplay names in chat channels.
