7.1.0.2 (2016-11-07):

	- The cursor book icon will no longer flicker briefly on the screen at its
	  last location prior to being displayed.

	- Water Elementals (Frost Mage) will once again properly display their
	  class color.

	- Latency spike tolerance for hiding player not found errors has been
	  increased to 5 seconds (from 2 seconds).

	- In cases of problems, more Lua errors will now be shown, but those
	  errors are less likely to cause other failures.

	- Some more taint issues have (hopefully) been fixed.
