5.4.8.0_beta2 (2014-06-02):

	- Chatnames:

		- Default settings have changed (for new installations only). Only
		  say, yell, and emotes will have RP names by default.

		- New types of chat are supported, including party, raid, instance,
		  and world/custom channels. These may be enabled/disabled (on a
		  per-channel basis for world/custom channels) in the interface
		  options.

		- A menu item is now added when right-clicking on a name in chat,
		  allowing quick access to view that character's profile.

	- Bugfixes:

		- A workaround has been implemented to stop the default raid frames
		  from being severely tainted by any addon using the interface options
		  system (including XRP).

			- This workaround has the minor drawback of changes made to a raid
			  profile not being automatically cancelled and restored to
			  previous settings when the interface options cancel button is
			  pressed.

		- A runaway pattern match would sometimes gobble up half of an emote
		  if targeting an off-realm player. Its hunger has been satiated.

		- Some issues that would occasionally cause the viewer's receiving
		  feedback to show incorrect statuses have been fixed.

		- An issue that could cause abnormal inflation of field version
		  numbers in rare cases has been fixed.

		- The minimap status toggles (both click and menu) should now behave
		  somewhat more predictably and usefully.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- There are likely compatibility issues with the chat names and
		  tooltip portions of XRP when used in combination with some other
		  addons which modify those same things. Compatibility problems will
		  fixed as possible, but these components have been (and will continue
		  to be) primarily designed around the default tooltip and chat
		  windows.
