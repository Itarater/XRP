5.4.7.0_beta6 (2014-05-16):

	- If you are upgrading from beta3 or earlier, please remove the old
	  folders first (xrp and all the xrpui folders) from Interface\AddOns.

	- A slash command, /xrp, has been added. Type /xrp or /xrp help to see how
	  to make use of it.

	- An optional indicator for if the character displayed on your tooltip is
	  targeting you has been added. It can be enabled in the Interface
	  Options (disabled by default).

	- Key bindings have been added/modified to allow for viewing mouseover
	  targets by keybind in addition to targets.

	- Bugfixes:

		- An error on sending a whisper to an offline or nonexistant player
		  has been fixed.

		- A possible race condition with sending profile data has been fixed.
		  This may have a very slight impact on load speed of you tooltip for
		  others.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- Trying to query a profile from someone while not visible (different
		  continent, different zone, or successfully stealthed for some time)
		  may fail, and may cause other sideaffects. This is due to a Blizzard
		  bug, and a workaround is being developed for the next beta.

			- NOTE: This bug happens with ALL RP addons right now. Some
			  trigger it more or less often, but all of them are potentially
			  affected by it. It is NOT an XRP bug.

		- You may VERY RARELY see "No player named ... is currently playing."
		  at seemingly random times. In general usage, these should no longer
		  appear at all. If they do, please inform the author, it probably
		  means that some timing changes need to happen.

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.
