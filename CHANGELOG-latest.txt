5.4.8.1 (2014-08-17):

	- NEW: Right clicking to view profile. On non-hostile player targets, a
	  book icon will pop up beside the mouse cursor. When this book icon is
	  visible, you can right click that player (just like with an NPC) to view
	  their RP profile. This is enabled by default, but not available while
	  in combat.

	- NEW: Blizzard's standard interact with target/mouseover keybinds can now
	  be used to view profiles of non-hostile player targets. This is enabled
	  by default, but not available while in combat.

	- EXTENDED: Right-click menu entries for viewing RP profiles are now in
	  more places (notably guild list right-click). This is enabled by default.

	- NEW: Right-click menu entries for unit frames can be enabled in the XRP
	  interface options. Note that doing so may cause unavoidable taint issues,
	  and will remove the "Set Focus" entry from those menus. This is disabled
	  by default.

	- NEW: Partial support for bookmarking profiles has been added. A checkbox
	  is now present next to the close button in the profile viewer; ticking
	  this box will bookmark the profile, setting it so that it will never be
	  removed from the cache.

		- In the future, this feature will be extended to allow for easy access
		  to bookmarked profiles. At current, only the cache preservation is
		  complete.

	- Bugfixes:

		- "Default (Old)" will not cause problems anymore. It can now properly
		  be selected for editing, use, and renaming/copying/deleting.

		- Rapidly opening the viewer before receiving tooltip information will
		  now properly load the full profile after the tooltip data has been
		  received.

	- Miscellaneous:

		- Options have been added to disable the right-click menu entry
		  integration and the %xt/%xf replacement intergration. These may be
		  found in the interface options.

		- The maximum bandwidth usage of XRP (and other addons using
		  ChatThrottleLib) has been reduced by 33% while in combat. This is
		  unchanged while out of combat.
