6.0.2.0_beta1 (2014-10-10):

	- THIS RELEASE IS FOR 6.0 ONLY. IT CANNOT BE USED ON 5.4.8 (LIVE).

	- This is an unstable release for use on beta and PTR. Please don't use it
	  on live 6.0 servers (a stable release should be up the morning of
	  October the 14th).

	- This version is compatible with 6.0. Changes have been made where
	  needed, and an ugly workaround has been removed due to bugs being fixed.
	  Hooray!

	- Profile parenting/inheritance has been vastly improved. Instead of
	  inheritance from "Default", any profile can be used as a parent profile,
	  inheriting select fields from that parent (or parents of parents, to a
	  maximum depth of 16).

		- The editor now shows what will be in your public profile when
		  editing. Inherited values are shown in grey text.

		- The "Default" profile is no longer treated specially and may be
		  renamed or removed at will (so long as it is not your active
		  profile).

	- An option to disable right-click profile viewing while PvP flagged has
	  been added.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Pressing enter or escape in popups with text boxes will now behave
		  in a more useful manner.

		- A display issue with player-imitating NPCs (such as in Proving
		  Grounds) in the tooltip has been fixed.

		- Potential bugs involving the Azjol-Nerub realm have been fixed.

	- Miscellaneous:

		- bit.ly URLs without http:// or https:// will should link properly in
		  profiles.

		- For the purposes of disabling right-click profile viewing, active
		  world PvP zones (i.e., Tol Barad or Wintergrasp while a battle is
		  in-progress) are now considered instances.

		- Persistent versioning of fields has been added. This may slightly
		  reduce bandwidth consumption in the case of rapid profile changes.

		- Stripping of certain types of punctuation surrounding names in
		  chat has been removed. It's difficult to handle properly and tends
		  to produce inconsistent results too often.

		- The warning about lengthy profiles has been removed (profile storage
		  changes made the warning unreliable). It may be re-added in another
		  form at a later release.

		- The XRP profile API has changed substantially. The documentation has
		  been removed from the addon distriubtion, but will be posted and
		  linked from the project page at a later date.
