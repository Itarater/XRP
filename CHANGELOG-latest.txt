5.4.8.0 (2014-07-28):

	- Tooltip options have been rearranged (but not changed) for consistency
	  and clarity. Default appearance and user-set appearance will not change.

	- Importing standard MSP values for roleplaying style will now import a
	  plain-text version, rather than the opaque numerical equivalent.

	- The /xrp view command will now automatically uppercase the first letter
	  of any character name.

	- Commas and colons are now re-spaced as apostrophes are in emotes.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Selection of text in the viewer behaves consistently now.

		- Fancy unicode apostrophes (used by some addons in emotes) will now
		  actually be properly re-spaced.

		- The viewer will now continue to load incomplete profiles even while
		  hidden (so the completed load can be reopened later via the minimap
		  menu or /xrp viewer).
