5.4.8.0_rc4 (2014-06-23):

	- In chat messages, %xt will now be replaced by your target's RP name (if
	  available; %t otherwise), and %xf will do the same for your focus's RP
	  name. If you do not have a target/focus, the word "nobody" will be used
	  instead.

	- The profile importer now informs the user if there are no supported RP
	  addons enabled, along with a hint of how to properly import profiles.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Precision for outgoing weight conversion has been increased to 3
		  significant digits (matching the three significant digits used in
		  height).

		- Height/weight conversion has been adjusted to be more forgiving of
		  extra whitespace. (Thanks, Forge.)

		- The maximum tooltip width has been slightly increased for most
		  lines.

		- The detachment of the minimap button should (?) work better with
		  some minimap-modifying addons now.

		- The label for the party chat option in the chat names configuration
		  now properly reads "Party" instead of "Raid".

		- Toggling the minimap icon from attached to detached or vice-versa
		  now properly warns that you may need to reload your UI.

		- A minor oddity with the import from MyRolePlay involving custom
		  IC/OOC statuses has been fixed (custom statuses are now imported as
		  "In character").

		- A few minor clarifications have been made to some text strings.
