6.0.2.1 (2014-10-16):

	- This version is compatible with 6.0.2.

		- If you are upgrading from a pre-6.0 version of XRP, it is STRONGLY
		  recommended to make a backup copy of your WTF folder, for the
		  unlikely case of something going wrong during either the XRP update
		  or the 6.0 game patch.

	- Bugs have been fixed:

		- A number of minor UI taints (especially Blizzard compact raid
		  frames) have been fixed.

		- A circumstance where recently-blanked fields could fail to send to
		  others has been fixed.

		- A rare Lua error involving automated profile swapping has been
		  fixed.

		- The LibMSP compatibility layer will once again properly load if
		  needed by other addons.
