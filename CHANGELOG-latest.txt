5.4.7.0_beta2 (2014-04-23):
	- Viewer:
		- Long fields can now be read via mouseover.
		- Addon information now strips version info (for space).
	- Editor:
		- New feature: Copy from Default. Checkboxes allow copying field
		  values for empty fields from the Default profile by, er, default.
		- Default can now be overwritten via rename or copy (so long as
		  Default (Old) does not exist or is the source).
		- Default is colored gold in the drop-down selector to note its
		  special status.
		- More warnings are visible when copying/renaming.
	- UI (Core):
		- Currently field can now be temporarily overriden (like IC/OOC
		  status) from the minimap menu.
		- Chat names can now be enabled/disabled for different types of chat
		  (i.e., whispers, guild chat, say, etc.).
	- Tooltip:
		- Long tooltip fields are more gracefully truncated now, and can wrap
		  to two lines long for certain fields.
	- Core:
		- There is now a loud warning when loading XRP alongside another RP
		  addon.
