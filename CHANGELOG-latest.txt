5.4.7.0_beta4 (2014-04-??):
	IMPORTANT: ADDON NAMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU **MUST** REMOVE ALL OLD COPIES
	OF xrp AND xrpui_* FROM YOUR INTERFACE\ADDONS FOLDER.

	- This reorganization was done to make maintenance easier. While it was
	  done there were significant changes to the file structure of several
	  components as well -- even had the addon names not changed, I would
	  still be recommending removing the old versions.

	- A couple of settings will be reset to defaults (minimap button position
	  and names-in-chat selection). Sorry for the inconvenience. (All profile
	  data, cache data, and other settings are preserved.)

	- Added xrp_import: This addon imports RP profiles from other RP addons,
	  into XRP. You can enable this along with all other RP addons you make
	  use of to import everything in one shot (the importer will prompt you to
	  reload your UI after it's finished -- XRP will be the only RP addon
	  enabled after the reload).

	- About/copyright information has been added in Interface Options.

	- Full options panel is now LoadOnDemand (loaded when accessing the about
	  panel).

	- Options item in menu has been removed (access it through the game menu's
	  Interface selection).

	- Bugfixes:

		- Default text emotes (/dance, /wave, etc.) from players on other
		  realms no longer produce a "no such player" warning, and now
		  properly color the name.

		- Secondary addons are now properly added to the version string.

		- Overwriting the currently active profile via rename (only possible
		  for "Default") now correctly loads/sends to others.

		- Filling fields from default now handles more logically -- setting
		  the defaults in the Interface Options will now only affect *new*
		  profiles, and old profiles will keep their settings.
