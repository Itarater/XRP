6.0.2.2_beta1 (2014-10-22):

	- This version introduces experimental support for sending/recieving RP
	  profiles over Battle.net (BattleTag/RealID). This enables limited
	  crossfaction and crossrealm support with your friends.

		- At current, XRP 6.0.2.2+ is the only addon to support this.

		- Once it is considered to be reasonably stable (likely meaning it's
		  in a stable release of XRP), work will be done on porting it to the
		  reference LibMSP used by other addons

	- Bugfixes:

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.
