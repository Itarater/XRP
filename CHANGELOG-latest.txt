5.4.7.0_beta4 (2014-04-27):
	IMPORTANT: ADDON NAMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU **MUST** REMOVE ALL OLD COPIES
	OF xrp AND xrpui_* FROM YOUR INTERFACE\ADDONS FOLDER PRIOR TO INSTALLING
	THE NEW VERSION.

	- This reorganization was done to make maintenance easier. While it was
	  done there were significant changes to the file structure of several
	  components as well -- even had the addon names not changed, I would
	  still be recommending removing the old versions. This will not happen
	  again prior to 5.4.7.0 final.

	- There is a failsafe for if someone doesn't read the above notice.
	  There's also a failsafe failsafe so they can't get stuck in a no-choice
	  loop with the no-choice Reload UI prompt.

	- A couple of settings will be reset to defaults (minimap button position
	  and names-in-chat selection). Sorry for the inconvenience. (All profile
	  data, cache data, and other settings are preserved.)

	- Added xrp_import: This addon imports RP profiles from other RP addons,
	  into XRP. You can enable this along with all other RP addons you make
	  use of to import everything in one shot (the importer will prompt you to
	  reload your UI after it's finished -- XRP will be the only RP addon
	  enabled after the reload).
		- Currently supported: MyRolePlay, TotalRP2.

	- About/copyright information has been added in Interface Options.

	- Full options panel is now LoadOnDemand (loaded when accessing the XRP
	  item in the Interface Options panel).

	- Options item in the minimap menu has been removed. Options should be
	  accessed through the game menu's Interface Options' AddOns tab.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Default text emotes (/dance, /wave, etc.) from players on other
		  realms no longer produce a "no such player" warning, and now
		  properly color the name.

		- Secondary addons are now properly added to the version string.

		- Overwriting the currently active profile via rename (only possible
		  for "Default") now correctly loads/sends to others.

		- Filling fields from default now handles more logically -- setting
		  the defaults in the Interface Options will now only affect *new*
		  profiles, and old profiles will keep their settings.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:
		- You may occasionally see "No player named ... is currently player."
		  messages seemingly at random. This typically occurs if someone has
		  recently queried your profile, but logged off before receiving. How
		  to properly deal with these is being considered for the future
		  (i.e., it shouldn't happen once out of beta, at latest).

		- Chat names don't work with addons such as Prat-3.0. Some other chat
		  addons (including Prat-3.0, since the author of XRP likes using it)
		  will be expliticly supported in the future.

		- Other addons cannot interact with XRP like they can some other
		  profile addons. This will be somewhat fixed (as best as is possible)
		  in the future by providing a compatibility layer for them to work
		  with.
