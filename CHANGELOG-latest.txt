6.0.2.2 (2014-10-??):

	- This version is compatible with 6.0.2.

		- If you are upgrading from a pre-6.0 version of XRP, it is STRONGLY
		  recommended to make a backup copy of your WTF folder, for the
		  unlikely case of something going wrong during either the XRP update
		  or the 6.0 game patch.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.
