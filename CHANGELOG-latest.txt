6.0.2.2_beta2 (2014-10-27):

	- This version reorganizes file and addon layout. You should remove all
	  old xrp components (i.e., xrp_import, xrp_libmsp, xrp_auto) prior to
	  upgrading. You should also exit the game while upgrading.

	- This version introduces experimental support for sending/recieving RP
	  profiles over Battle.net (BattleTag/RealID). This enables limited
	  crossfaction and crossrealm support with your friends.

		- At current, XRP 6.0.2.2+ is the only addon to support this.

		- Once it is considered to be reasonably stable (likely meaning it's
		  in a stable release of XRP), work will be done on porting it to the
		  reference LibMSP used by other addons

	- This version also introduces experimental support for sending/recieving
	  RP profiles over party or raid channels. This enables crossrealm
	  profiles while in a party or raid group, with others in that group.

		- The same restrictions as above apply for this feature.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.
