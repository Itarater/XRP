5.4.8.0_rc6 (2014-07-20):

	- The data storage format has changed and conversion is done automatically
	  on login. Once you upgrade to rc6, you cannot return to a previous
	  version.

	- The viewer now will report "No changes." after receiving 'new' versions
	  of fields for which there were no actual changes. This mainly occurred
	  when dealing with MyRolePlay, as it doesn't track changes as strictly as
	  XRP.

	- The "Too soon for updates." message in the viewer has been removed. It
	  became too difficult to maintain this behaviour with other code changes,
	  and the message was often confusing or meaningless without knowledge of
	  the underlying protocol/code.

	- The warning about a new version will now display once every 20 hours,
	  down from 24 hours.

	- More code refactoring and optimization. A few things are probably a bit
	  more reliable and/or faster now.

	- Bugfixes:

		- An issue where an offline character could be inaccurately reported
		  as opposite faction has been fixed (where possible).

		- Reverted a bandwidth limit change from rc5 which may have
		  occasionally been triggering disconnections.

		- Names in chat which consist solely of punctuation will no longer be
		  removed alltogether.

		- Apostrophe adjustments now also work with fancy Unicode apostrophes
		  (this mainly affects some addon-performed emotes).

		- New version warning should now properly stop showing after an
		  upgrade.

		- RP names in instance chat should now work.
