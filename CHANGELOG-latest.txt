6.0.2.0 (2014-10-14):

	- This version is compatible with 6.0.2.

		- If you are upgrading from a previous version of XRP, it is STRONGLY
		  recommended to make a backup copy of your WTF folder, for the
		  unlikely case of something going wrong during either the XRP update
		  or the 6.0 game patch.

	- Automated profile swapping has been added. This is accessed through the
	  minimap button under "Profile automation".

		- Please note this is EXPERIMENTAL and may not always work as
		  intended. If you have issues with automated swaps, please report the
		  bug and disable the XRP: Automation addon in the meanwhile.

	- Profile parenting/inheritance has been vastly improved. Instead of
	  inheritance from "Default", any profile can be used as a parent profile,
	  inheriting select fields from that parent (or parents of parents, to a
	  maximum depth of 16).

		- The editor now shows what will be in your public profile when
		  editing. Inherited values are shown in grey text.

		- The "Default" profile is no longer treated specially and may be
		  renamed or removed at will (so long as it is not your active
		  profile).

	- Hiding of profiles (in chat names and tooltips) has been added. This
	  option is toggled through a menu in the upper-right corner of the
	  viewer.

	- Miscellaneous:

		- Pressing enter or escape in popups with text boxes will now behave
		  in a more useful manner.

		- bit.ly URLs without http:// or https:// should link properly in
		  profiles.

		- An option to disable right-click profile viewing while PvP flagged
		  has been added.

		- For the purposes of disabling right-click profile viewing, active
		  world PvP zones (i.e., Tol Barad or Wintergrasp while a battle is
		  in-progress) are now considered instances.

		- Persistent versioning of fields has been added. This may slightly
		  reduce bandwidth consumption in the case of rapid profile changes.

		- Stripping of certain types of punctuation surrounding names in
		  chat has been removed. It's difficult to handle properly and tends
		  to produce inconsistent results too often.

		- The warning about lengthy profiles has been removed (profile storage
		  changes made the warning unreliable). It may be re-added in another
		  form at a later release.

		- The XRP profile API and characters API has changed substantially.
		  The documentation has been removed from the addon distriubtion, but
		  will be posted and linked from the project page at a later date.
