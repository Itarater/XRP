5.4.8.0_rc1 (2014-06-20):

	- A large amount of code cleanups and, in some cases, rewrites have been
	  done. This may have introduced minor bugs, however this release has been
	  fairly thoroughly tested (but only by one person).

	- Temporary field overrides (such as character status or currently changed
	  from minimap menu) should now persist for five minutes after logout
	  (including UI reloads). This will not happen on game client or computer
	  crashes, but should work properly with disconnects.

	- If there is a newer version of XRP available than you're currently
	  running, you will be warned at login once per 24 hours that you should
	  update. This should only notify you of releases of the same or higher
	  release quality (alpha/beta/rc/stable) -- if you run stable, you won't
	  be warned if there's a new beta version, for example.

	- Default save time for cached profiles has been increased to 10 days
	  (from 7 days). This helps in cases of once-a-week RP events having
	  profiles wiped before they come around again.

	- Viewer:

		- UI escape sequences are stripped prior to display. This includes
		  color codes and similar, to make display consistent.

	- Tooltip:

		- Reaction coloring has changed slightly. This should handle issues
		  with neutral/non-factioned players/pets a bit better (such as arises
		  with the Ordos Censer).

		- UI escape sequences (such as color codes) are more thoroughly
		  stripped from display values now. This prevents some odd subversions
		  of the tooltip display.

	- Chat names:

		- Most punctuation characters are now stripped from the start and end
		  of names to reduce distraction in some people's distracting
		  formatting styles. Potentially-legitimate punctuation has been
		  allowed to remain intact (such as brackets, quotation marks, etc.).

	- Bugfixes:

		- An issue that sometimes caused inflation of version stats for
		  certain fields (most commonly toon gender) has been fixed.

		- An issue with the Ordos PvP Censer causing incorrect pet tooltip
		  displays for one's own pet has been fixed.

		- An issue which could rarely cause a Lua error when changing zones
		  has been fixed.

		- Pet tooltips will correctly refresh if RP information about their
		  owner is received.
