5.4.7.0_beta4 (2014-04-??):
	IMPORTANT: ADDON NAMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU **MUST** REMOVE ALL OLD COPIES
	OF xrp AND xrpui_* FROM YOUR ADDONS FOLDER.

	- The above-noted reorganization was done to make maintaining and
	  understanding the structure of the addon simpler. Should be the only
	  time this happens.

	- About information has been added in Interface Options.
	- Full options panel is now LoadOnDemand (loaded when accessing the about
	  panel).
	- Options item in menu has been removed (access it through the game menu's
	  Interface selection).
	- Default default settings is handled more logically -- changing the
	  defaults in the options *ONLY* changes it for any new profiles. Old
	  profiles will now retain their settings, regardless of changes to the
	  defaults.
	- Localization has been partly implemented (incomplete, and no
	  translations available).
	- Memory usage has been optimized ever-so-slightly (some memory will now
	  be reclaimed during particularly long gaming sessions as possible).
