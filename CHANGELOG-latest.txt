5.4.8.2 (2014-08-31):

	- NEW: Roleplay class field. This adds the ability to provide a different
	  class name for roleplay purposes (such as "Assassin" rather than
	  "Rogue"), including in the viewer and tooltip.

		- The custom class in the tooltip will be colored with the player's
		  in-game class color (i.e., druid orange, hunter green, etc.) for
		  easy recognition.

		- This is currently only visible to other users of XRP 5.4.8.2 or
		  later.

	- NEW: Copyable URLs in profiles. In profiles, URLs will now be highlighted
	  epic purple and surrounded by square brackets. Clicking will provide
	  a popup dialog box where the URL may be copied from.

	- NEW: An option to show the numerical guild rank as well as the rank
	  name in tooltips has been added. The number starts at 1 (guild master)
	  and may have a maximum value of 9 (lowest rank).

		- NOTE: Not all guilds make use of rank levels in the same manner --
		  this is only available as a general indication of guild structure,
		  and not a canonical indication of officers, initiates, or any other
		  rank. The only rank that can be absolutely determined is the guild
		  master (1).

	- NEW: An option to disable the right-click profile viewing while inside
	  any sort of instance (raid, dungeon, arena, or battleground) has been
	  added.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Some odd interactions between click-to-move (a.k.a. autointeract)
		  and right-click/interact keybind profile viewing have been fixed.

		- The minimap button, while detached, now cannot end up hidden by
		  being moved offscreen somehow.

	- Miscellaneous:

		- The editor will now generally load your currently-selected profile
		  when shown, unless there are unsaved changes to an opened profile.
