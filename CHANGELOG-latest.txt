5.4.7.0_beta5 (2014-05-15):

	- If you are upgrading from beta3 or earlier, please remove the old
	  folders first (xrp and all the xrpui folders) from Interface\AddOns.

	- PLEASE READ:

		- Names in tooltips are now colored by reaction (green/yellow/red)
		  rather than faction (blue/yellow/red) by default. The old behavior
		  can be restored in the Interface Options.

		- Colored names in chat channels are no longer always used. To enable
		  name coloration for any given channel (including say, emotes, yells,
		  etc.), right click a chat tab, go to "Settings", and tick the class
		  color box for any or all types.

	- Other changes:

		- The window size of the editor and viewer has been substantially
		  increased. The height matches that of the spellbook, and the width
		  has been somewhat increased. The field entry/display has been
		  appropriately increased to match the new window sizes.

			- These changes were tested at 1920x1200 with UI scaling set to
			  lowest. If they cause problems for you at lower resolutions or
			  different UI scales, please inform the author -- an option to
			  use the smaller window sizes will likely be added in such a
			  case.

		- The tooltip module has been substantially upgraded. Among the new
		  features and changes:

			- New pet tooltips, showing pet type and owner's RP name. Pet
			  types display the family for Hunters (Wolf, Cat, etc.), the
			  summon type for Warlocks (Voidwalker, Voidlord, Fel Imp, etc.),
			  "Undead" for Unholy Death Knight ghouls/geists/skeletons, and
			  "Elemental" for Frost Mage water elementals.

				- Only permanent pets have these tooltips: temporary pets and
				  guardians do not. They may be supported in a future version,
				  but are not currently.

			- PvP indicator has been changed to an icon (Alliance, Horde, or
			  Free-For-All PvP indicator) at the far right of the first line.

			- Configuration options for fine-tuning certain aspects of the
			  tooltip are available in the Interface Options.

		- The offline profile cache will now automatically tidy itself up on
		  every login. By default, it will drop the cache for characters it
		  hasn't had an update from in seven days.

			- In the Interface Options, you can disable this automated
			  tidying, or adjust the length of time it will wait before
			  clearing out a character's cached RP data.

		- A LibMSP compatibility layer has been added. LibMSP Compat provides
		  an interface for addons expecting to find a traditional MSP
		  implementation to interact (partially) with XRP. Not all features of
		  LibMSP are available via this layer, but attempts to use unavailable
		  features should not produce an error.

			- This compatibility layer is enabled by default, but *WILL NOT*
			  be loaded unless it is needed and only when it is needed. Unless
			  you explicitly wish to disable this compatibility, it's
			  recommended you leave it enabled.

	- Bugfixes:

		- "Toggle viewer" in minimap menu should now work.

		- Minimap icon should now play better with minimap addons.

		- "No changes." appearing in the Viewer should work somewhat more
		  reliably.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- You may VERY RARELY see "No player named ... is currently playing."
		  at seemingly random times. In general usage, these should no longer
		  appear at all. If they do, please inform the author, it probably
		  means that some timing changes need to happen.

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.
