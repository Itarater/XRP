5.4.8.0_beta1 (2014-05-20):

	- TO ALL THE ROGUES I'VE LOVED BEFORE:

		- Your skulking ways are being enabled by this release. Go ahead,
		  stalk that pretty lady from down the guild roster and never let them
		  know you're there -- your RP addon is with you.

	- A Blizzard issue causing problems loading profiles while in stealth has
	  been worked around. This also allows profiles to reliably load at
	  significant distances (such as from entirely different continents).

		- There is a chance this loading may fail. If it ever does, please
		  inform the author with the circumstances of the failure. As much
		  detail as can be given is helpful.

		- This also may slightly slow the loading of profiles in some
		  circumstances, possibly up to as much as one second. Sorry, but this
		  cannot be helped while this workaround is needed.

	- More feedback has been added to the viewer window, including
	  notifications if the target does not appear to have an active RP addon,
	  if the target is offline, or if they've been queried recently enough
	  that we're not asking for changes yet.

	- /xrp profile has been added. This was intended to be in the last
	  release, but was forgotten.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The tooltip should now properly display "Level ??", rather than
		  "Level 0" under rare circumstances.

		- A rare error involving pets whose family could not be determined
		  should now be fixed.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.
