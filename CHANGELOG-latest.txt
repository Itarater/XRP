5.4.8.0_rc3 (2014-06-21):

	- The minimap icon can now be detached from the minimap and moved
	  independently. This option is found in the interface options panel -- be
	  warned, you may need to reload your UI (/reload) after changing the
	  setting for it to work entirely correctly, particularly in conjunction
	  with some minimap-modifying addons.

	- The default defaults settings which were confusing and ultimately
	  unnecessary have been removed. Inheritance from the Default profile is
	  now solely set per-profile in the editor.

	- The interface options panel can now be quickly accessed through the
	  minimap button.

	- The new version warning will now print a few seconds after login, making
	  it less likely to get lost in addon loading spam.

	- Bugfixes:

		- A minor bug that caused some issues when copying a profile in some
		  circumstances has been fixed. (Thanks, Zan.)

		- A few minor formatting errors have been fixed.

		- A rarely-occurring oddity with the TRP2 profile importer has been
		  fixed.
