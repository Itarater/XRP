5.4.7.0_beta3 (??? (unreleased)):
	- Core:
		- Embed ChatThrottleLib. Looking over my purposes, it's really just a
		  much more usable solution than write-my-own. Rewriting MSP is one
		  thing, but rewriting CTL isn't as smart, given how it interacts with
		  other addons. Yay for de-facto standards?...

	- UI:
		- Add Interface Options panel. This replaces the settings menu on the
		  minimap. It's still a bit ugly, but it should work just fine.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Error in xrpui_chatnames when a panda spoke in nom-language or made
		  a text emote. Thanks for not giving an easy way to determine
		  faction from GUID, Blizzard.
		- Fixed a concatenation error in xrpui_tooltip. Better check a value
		  exists before trying to concat it. (Thanks to Zivala for running
		  into it.)

	- Other:
		- Redundant copies of the GNU General Public License have been
		  removed. They should be re-added if the xrpui modules are ever
		  packaged separately from the xrp core.
