6.0.3.0_beta2 (2014-11-08):

	- This version reorganizes file and addon layout. You should remove all
	  old xrp components (i.e., xrp_import, xrp_libmsp, xrp_auto) prior to
	  upgrading. You should also exit the game while upgrading.

	- This version replaces ChatThrottleLib with a new bandwidth library
	  (necessary for supporting B.net profiles and easier support of group
	  MSP). It currently replaces ChatThrottleLib when present, which may
	  cause issues for addons relying on ChatThrottleLib in ways outside the
	  norm. If you encounter any errors related to ChatThrottleLib while
	  running this version of XRP, *PLEASE REPORT THEM*.

	- This version introduces experimental support for sending/recieving RP
	  profiles over Battle.net (BattleTag/RealID). This enables limited
	  crossfaction and crossrealm support with your friends.

		- At current, XRP 6.0.2.2+ is the only addon to support this.

		- Once it is considered to be reasonably stable (likely meaning it's
		  in a stable release of XRP), work will be done on porting it to the
		  reference LibMSP used by other addons

	- This version also introduces experimental support for sending/recieving
	  RP profiles over party or raid channels. This enables crossrealm
	  profiles while in a party or raid group, with others in that group.

		- The same restrictions as above apply for this feature. The priority
		  for profile sending/recieving is as follows:
				Battle.net > Standard > Group
		  This means you will not be using the party/raid implementation when
		  in a group with friends on your BattleTag or your realm.

	- The minimap tooltip has drastically changed. Hopefully it's more useful
	  now.

	- The positioning of "Roleplay Profile" in the right click menus has been
	  changed to just below the name of the character (i.e., first in the
	  menu).

	- Basic tooltip data will be prefetched in cases of not having any cached
	  data about a player, if they load your profile.

	- Detachment of the minimap button behaves differently now. Toggling modes
	  requires a UI reload (which will be prompted when the option is
	  changed), and the button can no longer be locked or unlocked. Instead,
	  shift+right click and drag will move it in detached mode.

	- The internal naming of the editor, automation config, and viewer frames
	  has changed. If you were making use of these (such as with an addon that
	  allows movement of UI panels), you may need to reconfigure it. If you
	  don't know what this means, you probably don't need to know anyway.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.

		- The editor will now properly display the fallback values for name,
		  race, and class (in grey) when they are not set for a profile or its
		  parents.

		- The viewer currently/description/motto/history fields will now
		  correctly hide their scrollbars when appropriate.

		- The viewer should no longer scroll a single pixel for descriptions
		  or histories of a particular length.

		- Fixed an issue where the viewer would sometimes report offline
		  characters as being opposite faction instead.

		- Roleplay names will now be used in channel leave/join messages, if
		  they are enabled for that channel.

		- Added a warning if the raid profiles dialog is opened when the
		  interface options is closed about possible tainting caused by
		  Blizzard bugs.
