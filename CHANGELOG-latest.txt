6.0.2.2 (2014-10-??):

	- This version is compatible with 6.0.2.

		- If you are upgrading from a pre-6.0 version of XRP, it is STRONGLY
		  recommended to make a backup copy of your WTF folder, for the
		  unlikely case of something going wrong during either the XRP update
		  or the 6.0 game patch.

	- This version introduces experimental support for sending/recieving RP
	  profiles over Battle.net (BattleTag/RealID). This enables limited
	  crossfaction and crossrealm support with your friends.

		- At current, XRP 6.0.2.2+ is the only addon to support this.

		- Once it is considered to be reasonably stable (likely meaning it's
		  in a stable release of XRP), work will be done on porting it to the
		  reference LibMSP used by other addons

	- Bugfixes:

		- The order of fields selected by pressing tab in the editor has been
		  fixed to match the display order.
