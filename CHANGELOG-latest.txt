5.4.8.0_rc5 (2014-06-29):

	- Overridden field timeout has been increased to 10 minutes after logout
	  (up from 5).

	- Extra spacing option for tooltip has been adjusted to grouping in a
	  3-2-3 format, rather than 3-3-2 ("Currently:" has been moved to the
	  bottom group).

	- Profiles will now progressively load (i.e., as they are recieved) in the
	  viewer. Short fields (such as height, weight, home, etc.) should be
	  loaded prior to long fields (description/history) for long profiles.

		- Note: This will often be imperceptible for profiles below roughly
		  4000 characters.

	- Outgoing bandwidth limits have been slightly adjusted. Profile sends
	  from XRP should be slightly faster now.

		- In the extremely unlikely event that this causes issues with
		  disconnects -- but note it was thoroughly tested and no disconnects
		  could be triggered -- please inform the author.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Use of %xt and %xf should no longer improperly print "nobody" when
		  used on NPC or other non-player targets.

		- An issue where the Blizzard stealth/range issue workaround could
		  send messages out-of-order in high-bandwidth circumstances has been
		  fixed.

		- An issue where being alt-tabbed in true fullscreen mode (not
		  Fullscreen (Windowed)) caused profiles to not be sent to others has
		  been mitigated. However, it's still not ideal to run true fullscreen
		  with RP addons, if you spend lots of time tabbed out.

		- An issue where bugs in other addons could trigger higher outgoing
		  bandwidth usage in XRP has been mitigated.

		- Minor optimizations have been made to the protocol and workaround
		  implementations; these should slightly improve reliability and
		  response times in some cases.

		- The active profile is now always updated properly when a field it
		  inherits from default is modified in the default profile.
