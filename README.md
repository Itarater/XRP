XRP Roleplay Profiles
=====================
In general, you should install a release zip, rather than clone this repo. If
you do want to use the git version directly, you need to clone into your addons
folder and recursively init/update all submodules.

Quick and dirty:
```
cd ${WARCRAFT_DIR}/Interface/AddOns/
git clone https://github.com/Itarater/XRP.git
cd XRP/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
