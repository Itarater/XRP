Copyright and License Notices
=============================
Copyright and license notices are included in the headers of all substantial
files. Files without copyright or license notices are considered by the
author to not meet the theshold of originality required for copyright, thus
consisting solely of non-copyrightable material, and may be treated as such.

The year is *not* necessarily included in these copyright notices, as it is not
required under the Berne Convention, and makes little sense for an author
clearly identified by their legal name in a country where copyright term for an
individual-authored work is limited based on the author's life. In the event of
an author's death, the notices will be updated to reflect the year of death for
that individual, assuming anyone is capable of doing so. Otherwise, obituaries
and official records will need to be relied upon in the distant future.

In the cases of anonymous or pseudonymous contributions that cannot be tied to
a legal name or a lifespan, the year of the contribution will be included in the
notices for that particular author.
