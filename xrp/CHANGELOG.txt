5.4.7.0_beta1:
	- First beta release.
	- Mostly feature-complete.
	- Known issues:
		- Some settings are unavailable.
		- Tooltip display truncates certain fields.
		- Viewer fails to fully display some fields if there is too much text
		  in them.
		- No localization support yet.
	- Be aware:
		- No import from other RP addons (yet).
		- Memory usage may be higher than some other addons due to storing all
		  seen profiles in SavedVariables (and re-loading them at start). In
		  the future, there will be options to control this behaviour more
		  closely.
