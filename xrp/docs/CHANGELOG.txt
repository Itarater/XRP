5.4.7.0_beta3 (2014-04-24):
	- Core:
		- Embed ChatThrottleLib. Looking over my purposes, it's really just a
		  much more usable solution than write-my-own. Rewriting MSP is one
		  thing, but rewriting CTL isn't as smart, given how it interacts with
		  other addons. Yay for de-facto standards?...

	- UI:
		- Add Interface Options panel. This replaces the settings menu on the
		  minimap. It's still a bit ugly, but it should work just fine. Note:
		  it must be loaded from the minimap icon as things currently stand --
		  it won't even be loaded until that's done, so you won't just find it
		  in the Interface options right after starting.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Error in xrpui_chatnames when a panda spoke in nom-language or made
		  a text emote. Thanks for not giving an easy way to determine
		  faction from GUID, Blizzard.
		- Fixed a concatenation error in xrpui_tooltip. Better check a value
		  exists before trying to concat it. (Thanks to Zivala for running
		  into it.)

	- Other:
		- Redundant copies of the GNU General Public License have been
		  removed. They should be re-added if the xrpui modules are ever
		  packaged separately from the xrp core.

5.4.7.0_beta2 (2014-04-23):
	- Viewer:
		- Long fields can now be read via mouseover.
		- Addon information now strips version info (for space).
	- Editor:
		- New feature: Copy from Default. Checkboxes allow copying field
		  values for empty fields from the Default profile by, er, default.
		- Default can now be overwritten via rename or copy (so long as
		  Default (Old) does not exist or is the source).
		- Default is colored gold in the drop-down selector to note its
		  special status.
		- More warnings are visible when copying/renaming.
	- UI (Core):
		- Currently field can now be temporarily overriden (like IC/OOC
		  status) from the minimap menu.
		- Chat names can now be enabled/disabled for different types of chat
		  (i.e., whispers, guild chat, say, etc.).
	- Tooltip:
		- Long tooltip fields are more gracefully truncated now, and can wrap
		  to two lines long for certain fields.
	- Core:
		- There is now a loud warning when loading XRP alongside another RP
		  addon.

5.4.7.0_beta1:
	- First beta release.
	- Mostly feature-complete.
	- Known issues:
		- Some settings are unavailable.
		- Tooltip display truncates certain fields.
		- Viewer fails to fully display some fields if there is too much text
		  in them.
		- No localization support yet.
	- Be aware:
		- No import from other RP addons (yet).
		- Memory usage may be higher than some other addons due to storing all
		  seen profiles in SavedVariables (and re-loading them at start). In
		  the future, there will be options to control this behaviour more
		  closely.
