5.4.8.0 (2014-07-28):

	- Tooltip options have been rearranged (but not changed) for consistency
	  and clarity. Default appearance and user-set appearance will not change.

	- Importing standard MSP values for roleplaying style will now import a
	  plain-text version, rather than the opaque numerical equivalent.

	- The /xrp view command will now automatically uppercase the first letter
	  of any character name.

	- Commas and colons are now re-spaced as apostrophes are in emotes.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Selection of text in the viewer behaves consistently now.

		- Fancy unicode apostrophes (used by some addons in emotes) will now
		  actually be properly re-spaced.

		- The viewer will now continue to load incomplete profiles even while
		  hidden (so the completed load can be reopened later via the minimap
		  menu or /xrp viewer).

5.4.8.0_rc6 (2014-07-20):

	- The data storage format has changed and conversion is done automatically
	  on login. Once you upgrade to rc6, you cannot return to a previous
	  version.

	- The viewer now will report "No changes." after receiving 'new' versions
	  of fields for which there were no actual changes. This mainly occurred
	  when dealing with MyRolePlay, as it doesn't track changes as strictly as
	  XRP.

	- The "Too soon for updates." message in the viewer has been removed. It
	  became too difficult to maintain this behaviour with other code changes,
	  and the message was often confusing or meaningless without knowledge of
	  the underlying protocol/code.

	- The warning about a new version will now display once every 20 hours,
	  down from 24 hours.

	- More code refactoring and optimization. A few things are probably a bit
	  more reliable and/or faster now.

	- Bugfixes:

		- An issue where an offline character could be inaccurately reported
		  as opposite faction has been fixed (where possible).

		- Reverted a bandwidth limit change from rc5 which may have
		  occasionally been triggering disconnections.

		- Names in chat which consist solely of punctuation will no longer be
		  removed alltogether.

		- Apostrophe adjustments now also work with fancy Unicode apostrophes
		  (this mainly affects some addon-performed emotes).

		- New version warning should now properly stop showing after an
		  upgrade.

		- RP names in instance chat should now work.

5.4.8.0_rc5 (2014-06-29):

	- Overridden field timeout has been increased to 10 minutes after logout
	  (up from 5).

	- Extra spacing option for tooltip has been adjusted to grouping in a
	  3-2-3 format, rather than 3-3-2 ("Currently:" has been moved to the
	  bottom group).

	- Profiles will now progressively load (i.e., as they are recieved) in the
	  viewer. Short fields (such as height, weight, home, etc.) should be
	  loaded prior to long fields (description/history) for long profiles.

		- Note: This will often be imperceptible for profiles below roughly
		  4000 characters.

	- Outgoing bandwidth limits have been slightly adjusted. Profile sends
	  from XRP should be slightly faster now.

		- In the extremely unlikely event that this causes issues with
		  disconnects -- but note it was thoroughly tested and no disconnects
		  could be triggered -- please inform the author.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Use of %xt and %xf should no longer improperly print "nobody" when
		  used on NPC or other non-player targets.

		- An issue where the Blizzard stealth/range issue workaround could
		  send messages out-of-order in high-bandwidth circumstances has been
		  fixed.

		- An issue where being alt-tabbed in true fullscreen mode (not
		  Fullscreen (Windowed)) caused profiles to not be sent to others has
		  been mitigated. However, it's still not ideal to run true fullscreen
		  with RP addons, if you spend lots of time tabbed out.

		- An issue where bugs in other addons could trigger higher outgoing
		  bandwidth usage in XRP has been mitigated.

		- Minor optimizations have been made to the protocol and workaround
		  implementations; these should slightly improve reliability and
		  response times in some cases.

		- The active profile is now always updated properly when a field it
		  inherits from default is modified in the default profile.

5.4.8.0_rc4 (2014-06-23):

	- In chat messages, %xt will now be replaced by your target's RP name (if
	  available; %t otherwise), and %xf will do the same for your focus's RP
	  name. If you do not have a target/focus, the word "nobody" will be used
	  instead.

	- The profile importer now informs the user if there are no supported RP
	  addons enabled, along with a hint of how to properly import profiles.

	- Bugfixes:

		- Precision for outgoing weight conversion has been increased to 3
		  significant digits (matching the three significant digits used in
		  height).

		- Height/weight conversion has been adjusted to be more forgiving of
		  extra whitespace. (Thanks, Forge.)

		- The maximum tooltip width has been slightly increased for most
		  lines.

		- The detachment of the minimap button should (?) work better with
		  some minimap-modifying addons now.

		- The label for the party chat option in the chat names configuration
		  now properly reads "Party" instead of "Raid".

		- Toggling the minimap icon from attached to detached or vice-versa
		  now properly warns that you may need to reload your UI.

		- A minor oddity with the import from MyRolePlay involving custom
		  IC/OOC statuses has been fixed (custom statuses are now imported as
		  "In character").

		- A few minor clarifications have been made to some text strings.

5.4.8.0_rc3 (2014-06-21):

	- The minimap icon can now be detached from the minimap and moved
	  independently. This option is found in the interface options panel -- be
	  warned, you may need to reload your UI (/reload) after changing the
	  setting for it to work entirely correctly, particularly in conjunction
	  with some minimap-modifying addons.

	- The default defaults settings which were confusing and ultimately
	  unnecessary have been removed. Inheritance from the Default profile is
	  now solely set per-profile in the editor.

	- The interface options panel can now be quickly accessed through the
	  minimap button.

	- The new version warning will now print a few seconds after login, making
	  it less likely to get lost in addon loading spam.

	- Bugfixes:

		- A minor bug that caused some issues when copying a profile in some
		  circumstances has been fixed. (Thanks, Zan.)

		- A few minor formatting errors have been fixed.

		- A rarely-occurring oddity with the TRP2 profile importer has been
		  fixed.

5.4.8.0_rc2 (2014-06-20):

	- Bugfixes:

		- A serious bug that could end up in message order being scrambled has
		  been fixed. It occurred more with longer profiles.

5.4.8.0_rc1 (2014-06-20):

	- A large amount of code cleanups and, in some cases, rewrites have been
	  done. This may have introduced minor bugs, however this release has been
	  fairly thoroughly tested (but only by one person).

	- Temporary field overrides (such as character status or currently changed
	  from minimap menu) should now persist for five minutes after logout
	  (including UI reloads). This will not happen on game client or computer
	  crashes, but should work properly with disconnects.

	- If there is a newer version of XRP available than you're currently
	  running, you will be warned at login once per 24 hours that you should
	  update. This should only notify you of releases of the same or higher
	  release quality (alpha/beta/rc/stable) -- if you run stable, you won't
	  be warned if there's a new beta version, for example.

	- Default save time for cached profiles has been increased to 10 days
	  (from 7 days). This helps in cases of once-a-week RP events having
	  profiles wiped before they come around again.

	- Viewer:

		- UI escape sequences are stripped prior to display. This includes
		  color codes and similar, to make display consistent.

	- Tooltip:

		- Reaction coloring has changed slightly. This should handle issues
		  with neutral/non-factioned players/pets a bit better (such as arises
		  with the Ordos Censer).

		- UI escape sequences (such as color codes) are more thoroughly
		  stripped from display values now. This prevents some odd subversions
		  of the tooltip display.

	- Chat names:

		- Most punctuation characters are now stripped from the start and end
		  of names to reduce distraction in some people's distracting
		  formatting styles. Potentially-legitimate punctuation has been
		  allowed to remain intact (such as brackets, quotation marks, etc.).

	- Bugfixes:

		- An issue that sometimes caused inflation of version stats for
		  certain fields (most commonly toon gender) has been fixed.

		- An issue with the Ordos PvP Censer causing incorrect pet tooltip
		  displays for one's own pet has been fixed.

		- An issue which could rarely cause a Lua error when changing zones
		  has been fixed.

		- Pet tooltips will correctly refresh if RP information about their
		  owner is received.

5.4.8.0_beta2 (2014-06-02):

	- Chatnames:

		- Default settings have changed (for new installations only). Only
		  say, yell, and emotes will have RP names by default.

		- New types of chat are supported, including party, raid, instance,
		  and world/custom channels. These may be enabled/disabled (on a
		  per-channel basis for world/custom channels) in the interface
		  options.

		- A menu item is now added when right-clicking on a name in chat,
		  allowing quick access to view that character's profile.

	- Bugfixes:

		- A workaround has been implemented to stop the default raid frames
		  from being severely tainted by any addon using the interface options
		  system (including XRP).

			- This workaround has the minor drawback of changes made to a raid
			  profile not being automatically cancelled and restored to
			  previous settings when the interface options cancel button is
			  pressed.

		- A runaway pattern match would sometimes gobble up half of an emote
		  if targeting an off-realm player. Its hunger has been satiated.

		- Some issues that would occasionally cause the viewer's receiving
		  feedback to show incorrect statuses have been fixed.

		- An issue that could cause abnormal inflation of field version
		  numbers in rare cases has been fixed.

		- The minimap status toggles (both click and menu) should now behave
		  somewhat more predictably and usefully.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- There are likely compatibility issues with the chat names and
		  tooltip portions of XRP when used in combination with some other
		  addons which modify those same things. Compatibility problems will
		  fixed as possible, but these components have been (and will continue
		  to be) primarily designed around the default tooltip and chat
		  windows.

5.4.8.0_beta1 (2014-05-20):

	- TO ALL THE ROGUES I'VE LOVED BEFORE:

		- Your skulking ways are being enabled by this release. Go ahead,
		  stalk that pretty lady from down the guild roster and never let them
		  know you're there -- your RP addon is with you.

	- A Blizzard issue causing problems loading profiles while in stealth has
	  been worked around. This also allows profiles to reliably load at
	  significant distances (such as from entirely different continents).

		- There is a chance this loading may fail. If it ever does, please
		  inform the author with the circumstances of the failure. As much
		  detail as can be given is helpful.

		- This also may slightly slow the loading of profiles in some
		  circumstances, possibly up to as much as one second. Sorry, but this
		  cannot be helped while this workaround is needed.

	- More feedback has been added to the viewer window, including
	  notifications if the target does not appear to have an active RP addon,
	  if the target is offline, or if they've been queried recently enough
	  that we're not asking for changes yet.

	- /xrp profile has been added. This was intended to be in the last
	  release, but was forgotten.

	- Bugfixes:

		- The tooltip should now properly display "Level ??", rather than
		  "Level 0" under rare circumstances.

		- A rare error involving pets whose family could not be determined
		  should now be fixed.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.

5.4.7.0_beta6 (2014-05-16):

	- If you are upgrading from beta3 or earlier, please remove the old
	  folders first (xrp and all the xrpui folders) from Interface\AddOns.

	- A slash command, /xrp, has been added. Type /xrp or /xrp help to see how
	  to make use of it.

	- An optional indicator for if the character displayed on your tooltip is
	  targeting you has been added. It can be enabled in the Interface
	  Options (disabled by default).

	- Key bindings have been added/modified to allow for viewing mouseover
	  targets by keybind in addition to targets.

	- Bugfixes:

		- An error on sending a whisper to an offline or nonexistant player
		  has been fixed.

		- A possible race condition with sending profile data has been fixed.
		  This may have a very slight impact on load speed of you tooltip for
		  others.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- Trying to query a profile from someone while not visible (different
		  continent, different zone, or successfully stealthed for some time)
		  may fail, and may cause other sideaffects. This is due to a Blizzard
		  bug, and a workaround is being developed for the next beta.

			- NOTE: This bug happens with ALL RP addons right now. Some
			  trigger it more or less often, but all of them are potentially
			  affected by it. It is NOT an XRP bug.

		- You may VERY RARELY see "No player named ... is currently playing."
		  at seemingly random times. In general usage, these should no longer
		  appear at all. If they do, please inform the author, it probably
		  means that some timing changes need to happen.

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.

5.4.7.0_beta5 (2014-05-15):

	- If you are upgrading from beta3 or earlier, please remove the old
	  folders first (xrp and all the xrpui folders) from Interface\AddOns.

	- PLEASE READ:

		- Names in tooltips are now colored by reaction (green/yellow/red)
		  rather than faction (blue/yellow/red) by default. The old behavior
		  can be restored in the Interface Options.

		- Colored names in chat channels are no longer always used. To enable
		  name coloration for any given channel (including say, emotes, yells,
		  etc.), right click a chat tab, go to "Settings", and tick the class
		  color box for any or all types.

	- Other changes:

		- The window size of the editor and viewer has been substantially
		  increased. The height matches that of the spellbook, and the width
		  has been somewhat increased. The field entry/display has been
		  appropriately increased to match the new window sizes.

			- These changes were tested at 1920x1200 with UI scaling set to
			  lowest. If they cause problems for you at lower resolutions or
			  different UI scales, please inform the author -- an option to
			  use the smaller window sizes will likely be added in such a
			  case.

		- The tooltip module has been substantially upgraded. Among the new
		  features and changes:

			- New pet tooltips, showing pet type and owner's RP name. Pet
			  types display the family for Hunters (Wolf, Cat, etc.), the
			  summon type for Warlocks (Voidwalker, Voidlord, Fel Imp, etc.),
			  "Undead" for Unholy Death Knight ghouls/geists/skeletons, and
			  "Elemental" for Frost Mage water elementals.

				- Only permanent pets have these tooltips: temporary pets and
				  guardians do not. They may be supported in a future version,
				  but are not currently.

			- PvP indicator has been changed to an icon (Alliance, Horde, or
			  Free-For-All PvP indicator) at the far right of the first line.

			- Configuration options for fine-tuning certain aspects of the
			  tooltip are available in the Interface Options.

		- The offline profile cache will now automatically tidy itself up on
		  every login. By default, it will drop the cache for characters it
		  hasn't had an update from in seven days.

			- In the Interface Options, you can disable this automated
			  tidying, or adjust the length of time it will wait before
			  clearing out a character's cached RP data.

		- A LibMSP compatibility layer has been added. LibMSP Compat provides
		  an interface for addons expecting to find a traditional MSP
		  implementation to interact (partially) with XRP. Not all features of
		  LibMSP are available via this layer, but attempts to use unavailable
		  features should not produce an error.

			- This compatibility layer is enabled by default, but *WILL NOT*
			  be loaded unless it is needed and only when it is needed. Unless
			  you explicitly wish to disable this compatibility, it's
			  recommended you leave it enabled.

	- Bugfixes:

		- "Toggle viewer" in minimap menu should now work.

		- Minimap icon should now play better with minimap addons.

		- "No changes." appearing in the Viewer should work somewhat more
		  reliably.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:

		- You may VERY RARELY see "No player named ... is currently playing."
		  at seemingly random times. In general usage, these should no longer
		  appear at all. If they do, please inform the author, it probably
		  means that some timing changes need to happen.

		- Chat names don't work with some addons, such as Prat-3.0. However,
		  they also work just fine with other addons -- your milage will
		  almost certainly vary. Some non-working addons may become explicitly
		  supported in the future.

5.4.7.0_beta4 (2014-04-27):
	IMPORTANT: ADDON NAMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU **MUST** REMOVE ALL OLD COPIES
	OF xrp AND xrpui_* FROM YOUR INTERFACE\ADDONS FOLDER PRIOR TO INSTALLING
	THE NEW VERSION.

	- This reorganization was done to make maintenance easier. While it was
	  done there were significant changes to the file structure of several
	  components as well -- even had the addon names not changed, I would
	  still be recommending removing the old versions. This will not happen
	  again prior to 5.4.7.0 final.

	- There is a failsafe for if someone doesn't read the above notice.
	  There's also a failsafe failsafe so they can't get stuck in a no-choice
	  loop with the no-choice Reload UI prompt.

	- A couple of settings will be reset to defaults (minimap button position
	  and names-in-chat selection). Sorry for the inconvenience. (All profile
	  data, cache data, and other settings are preserved.)

	- Added xrp_import: This addon imports RP profiles from other RP addons,
	  into XRP. You can enable this along with all other RP addons you make
	  use of to import everything in one shot (the importer will prompt you to
	  reload your UI after it's finished -- XRP will be the only RP addon
	  enabled after the reload).
		- Currently supported: MyRolePlay, TotalRP2.

	- About/copyright information has been added in Interface Options.

	- Full options panel is now LoadOnDemand (loaded when accessing the XRP
	  item in the Interface Options panel).

	- Options item in the minimap menu has been removed. Options should be
	  accessed through the game menu's Interface Options' AddOns tab.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Default text emotes (/dance, /wave, etc.) from players on other
		  realms no longer produce a "no such player" warning, and now
		  properly color the name.

		- Secondary addons are now properly added to the version string.

		- Overwriting the currently active profile via rename (only possible
		  for "Default") now correctly loads/sends to others.

		- Filling fields from default now handles more logically -- setting
		  the defaults in the Interface Options will now only affect *new*
		  profiles, and old profiles will keep their settings.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:
		- You may occasionally see "No player named ... is currently player."
		  messages seemingly at random. This typically occurs if someone has
		  recently queried your profile, but logged off before receiving. How
		  to properly deal with these is being considered for the future
		  (i.e., it shouldn't happen once out of beta, at latest).

		- Chat names don't work with addons such as Prat-3.0. Some other chat
		  addons (including Prat-3.0, since the author of XRP likes using it)
		  will be expliticly supported in the future.

		- Other addons cannot interact with XRP like they can some other
		  profile addons. This will be somewhat fixed (as best as is possible)
		  in the future by providing a compatibility layer for them to work
		  with.

5.4.7.0_beta3 (2014-04-24):
	- Core:
		- Embed ChatThrottleLib. Looking over my purposes, it's really just a
		  much more usable solution than write-my-own. Rewriting MSP is one
		  thing, but rewriting CTL isn't as smart, given how it interacts with
		  other addons. Yay for de-facto standards?...

	- UI:
		- Add Interface Options panel. This replaces the settings menu on the
		  minimap. It's still a bit ugly, but it should work just fine. Note:
		  it must be loaded from the minimap icon as things currently stand --
		  it won't even be loaded until that's done, so you won't just find it
		  in the Interface options right after starting.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Error in xrpui_chatnames when a panda spoke in nom-language or made
		  a text emote. Thanks for not giving an easy way to determine
		  faction from GUID, Blizzard.
		- Fixed a concatenation error in xrpui_tooltip. Better check a value
		  exists before trying to concat it. (Thanks to Zivala for running
		  into it.)

	- Other:
		- Redundant copies of the GNU General Public License have been
		  removed. They should be re-added if the xrpui modules are ever
		  packaged separately from the xrp core.

5.4.7.0_beta2 (2014-04-23):
	- Viewer:
		- Long fields can now be read via mouseover.
		- Addon information now strips version info (for space).
	- Editor:
		- New feature: Copy from Default. Checkboxes allow copying field
		  values for empty fields from the Default profile by, er, default.
		- Default can now be overwritten via rename or copy (so long as
		  Default (Old) does not exist or is the source).
		- Default is colored gold in the drop-down selector to note its
		  special status.
		- More warnings are visible when copying/renaming.
	- UI (Core):
		- Currently field can now be temporarily overriden (like IC/OOC
		  status) from the minimap menu.
		- Chat names can now be enabled/disabled for different types of chat
		  (i.e., whispers, guild chat, say, etc.).
	- Tooltip:
		- Long tooltip fields are more gracefully truncated now, and can wrap
		  to two lines long for certain fields.
	- Core:
		- There is now a loud warning when loading XRP alongside another RP
		  addon.

5.4.7.0_beta1:
	- First beta release.
	- Mostly feature-complete.
	- Known issues:
		- Some settings are unavailable.
		- Tooltip display truncates certain fields.
		- Viewer fails to fully display some fields if there is too much text
		  in them.
		- No localization support yet.
	- Be aware:
		- No import from other RP addons (yet).
		- Memory usage may be higher than some other addons due to storing all
		  seen profiles in SavedVariables (and re-loading them at start). In
		  the future, there will be options to control this behaviour more
		  closely.
