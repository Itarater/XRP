5.4.7.0_beta4 (2014-04-27):
	IMPORTANT: ADDON NAMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU **MUST** REMOVE ALL OLD COPIES
	OF xrp AND xrpui_* FROM YOUR INTERFACE\ADDONS FOLDER PRIOR TO INSTALLING
	THE NEW VERSION.

	- This reorganization was done to make maintenance easier. While it was
	  done there were significant changes to the file structure of several
	  components as well -- even had the addon names not changed, I would
	  still be recommending removing the old versions. This will not happen
	  again prior to 5.4.7.0 final.

	- There is a failsafe for if someone doesn't read the above notice.
	  There's also a failsafe failsafe so they can't get stuck in a no-choice
	  loop with the no-choice Reload UI prompt.

	- A couple of settings will be reset to defaults (minimap button position
	  and names-in-chat selection). Sorry for the inconvenience. (All profile
	  data, cache data, and other settings are preserved.)

	- Added xrp_import: This addon imports RP profiles from other RP addons,
	  into XRP. You can enable this along with all other RP addons you make
	  use of to import everything in one shot (the importer will prompt you to
	  reload your UI after it's finished -- XRP will be the only RP addon
	  enabled after the reload).
		- Currently supported: MyRolePlay, TotalRP2.

	- About/copyright information has been added in Interface Options.

	- Full options panel is now LoadOnDemand (loaded when accessing the XRP
	  item in the Interface Options panel).

	- Options item in the minimap menu has been removed. Options should be
	  accessed through the game menu's Interface Options' AddOns tab.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Default text emotes (/dance, /wave, etc.) from players on other
		  realms no longer produce a "no such player" warning, and now
		  properly color the name.

		- Secondary addons are now properly added to the version string.

		- Overwriting the currently active profile via rename (only possible
		  for "Default") now correctly loads/sends to others.

		- Filling fields from default now handles more logically -- setting
		  the defaults in the Interface Options will now only affect *new*
		  profiles, and old profiles will keep their settings.

	- KNOWN ISSUES:
		- You may occasionally see "No player named ... is currently player."
		  messages seemingly at random. This typically occurs if someone has
		  recently queried your profile, but logged off before receiving. How
		  to properly deal with these is being considered for the future
		  (i.e., it shouldn't happen once out of beta, at latest).

		- Chat names don't work with addons such as Prat-3.0. Some other chat
		  addons (including Prat-3.0, since the author of XRP likes using it)
		  will be expliticly supported in the future.

		- Other addons cannot interact with XRP like they can some other
		  profile addons. This will be somewhat fixed (as best as is possible)
		  in the future by providing a compatibility layer for them to work
		  with.

5.4.7.0_beta3 (2014-04-24):
	- Core:
		- Embed ChatThrottleLib. Looking over my purposes, it's really just a
		  much more usable solution than write-my-own. Rewriting MSP is one
		  thing, but rewriting CTL isn't as smart, given how it interacts with
		  other addons. Yay for de-facto standards?...

	- UI:
		- Add Interface Options panel. This replaces the settings menu on the
		  minimap. It's still a bit ugly, but it should work just fine. Note:
		  it must be loaded from the minimap icon as things currently stand --
		  it won't even be loaded until that's done, so you won't just find it
		  in the Interface options right after starting.

	- Bugfixes:
		- Error in xrpui_chatnames when a panda spoke in nom-language or made
		  a text emote. Thanks for not giving an easy way to determine
		  faction from GUID, Blizzard.
		- Fixed a concatenation error in xrpui_tooltip. Better check a value
		  exists before trying to concat it. (Thanks to Zivala for running
		  into it.)

	- Other:
		- Redundant copies of the GNU General Public License have been
		  removed. They should be re-added if the xrpui modules are ever
		  packaged separately from the xrp core.

5.4.7.0_beta2 (2014-04-23):
	- Viewer:
		- Long fields can now be read via mouseover.
		- Addon information now strips version info (for space).
	- Editor:
		- New feature: Copy from Default. Checkboxes allow copying field
		  values for empty fields from the Default profile by, er, default.
		- Default can now be overwritten via rename or copy (so long as
		  Default (Old) does not exist or is the source).
		- Default is colored gold in the drop-down selector to note its
		  special status.
		- More warnings are visible when copying/renaming.
	- UI (Core):
		- Currently field can now be temporarily overriden (like IC/OOC
		  status) from the minimap menu.
		- Chat names can now be enabled/disabled for different types of chat
		  (i.e., whispers, guild chat, say, etc.).
	- Tooltip:
		- Long tooltip fields are more gracefully truncated now, and can wrap
		  to two lines long for certain fields.
	- Core:
		- There is now a loud warning when loading XRP alongside another RP
		  addon.

5.4.7.0_beta1:
	- First beta release.
	- Mostly feature-complete.
	- Known issues:
		- Some settings are unavailable.
		- Tooltip display truncates certain fields.
		- Viewer fails to fully display some fields if there is too much text
		  in them.
		- No localization support yet.
	- Be aware:
		- No import from other RP addons (yet).
		- Memory usage may be higher than some other addons due to storing all
		  seen profiles in SavedVariables (and re-loading them at start). In
		  the future, there will be options to control this behaviour more
		  closely.
