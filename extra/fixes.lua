-- Closing interface options after viewing the raid profiles (compact raid

-- This is kinda terrifying, but it fixes some major UI tainting when the user
-- presses "Cancel" in the Interface Options (out of combat). The drawback is
-- that any changes made to the default compact raid frames aren't actually
-- cancelled (they're not saved, but they're still active). Still, this is
-- better than having the Cancel button completely taint the raid frames.

	-- The following is disabled to make it more obvious that changes aren't
	-- really cancelled.
	--RestoreRaidProfileFromCopy()

	CompactUnitFrameProfiles_UpdateCurrentPanel()

	-- The following is disabled because it's the actual function that taints
	-- everything. The execution path is tainted by the time this function is
	-- called if there's any addon with an Interface Options panel.
