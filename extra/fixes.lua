-- presses "Cancel" in the Interface Options (out of combat). The drawback is
-- that any changes made to the default compact raid frames aren't actually

-- better than having the Cancel button completely taint the raid frames, and
-- then have that taint spread further.

-- re-enable it. If those addons want to disable it on default frames, it
